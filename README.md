### Detailed info
WIP


### TODO 
- Add markdown syntax highlighting and toolbar
- Add class for loading old versions of storage file

  So, if current version 5 and file version is 2, class will apply migrations 3, 4, 5

- Add files storage (convert file to base64, and encrypt if needed)

  Maybe as FilesGroup, with possible encryption (each gorup with separate key)
